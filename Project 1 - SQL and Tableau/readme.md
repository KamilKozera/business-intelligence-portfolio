# [Project 1: Global COVID-19 Data Exploration and Tableau Visualisation](https://github.com/KamilKozera/business-intelligence-portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20SQL%20and%20Tableau)

This GitHub project is dedicated to the analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The SQL code provided covers a wide range of operations, from fundamental data selection to advanced calculations and aggregations. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights into excel files and visualize them in Tableau public.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical COVID-19 data from [https://ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) which is updated daily. The dataset includes information such as iso_code, date, continent, location, new cases, new deaths, total cases, total deaths and more. Visit ourworldindata.org to learn more.

## Database
To facilitate data management and analysis, a MS SQL database has been created to store the dataset. SQL provides a robust and efficient way to query and manipulate the data. The database schema has been designed to ensure proper organization and ease of use. 

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the ourworldindata.org website might require some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. SQL queries have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Finished Dashboard

My main aim in crafting this Tableau visualization was to convey the gravity of COVID-19 statistics while ensuring visual appeal. Overall, the goal was to present the severity of the situation in a clear, impactful, and considerate manner. Click the image to see extended view.
