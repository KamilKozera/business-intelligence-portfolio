/*Itâ€™s a bit of a slow day in the office. Though Satchel no longer plays,
in 5.sql, write a SQL query to find all teams that Satchel Paige played for.

Your query should return a table with a single column, one for the name of the teams.

Executing 5.sql results in a table with 1 column and 3 rows.*/
